## Project Goals
* Introductory Vue Project
* Routing with vue-router
* CRUD functionality
* Call an API with Axios
* State management with vuex
* Simple Python backend (Flask) with local Postgres DB on Pi

This was made to mess around with VueJS and is obviously not a production level application.
For sake of simplicity, this runs locally for a single user.
I did not deploy it anywhere, but I took a couple screenshots so I could remember what it looked like myself.

I also got kind of bored of the project towards the end. So, I cut some stuff out...see below.

## Setup
I wouldn't suggest setting this up.
But, I did take some notes in [docs/](docs/), [app/](app/), [api/](api/), and [data/](data/)**.

* Setup environment file at **/dev.env** based on **/dev.env.example**


| Port | Description | Docker ? |

| 8020 | Flask API   | Yes      |
| 8021 | Vue App     | Yes      |


## Missing Features
Features that I ended up leaving out because I got bored with the project.

* Display random team on home page
* Popup alerts for deleting, creating, etc.
* Alternate sprite forms - Regional variants, type variants, etc.
* Full modal for team member (missing sprite preview, sprite form, etc.)
* Pokemon lookup by name in team member modal
* Form validation within modal
* Better styling...lol
* There's most definitely some UI bugs I missed
* Docker for frontend
* Docker compose
