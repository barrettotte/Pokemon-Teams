# Pokemon-Teams

An introductory VueJS app to record Pokemon teams used across various games and/or playthroughs.

This was made to mess around with VueJS and is not a production level application. It runs locally for a single user. I really just wanted to focus on frontend with this project.


## Project Goals
* Introductory Vue Project
* Routing with vue-router
* CRUD functionality
* External API usage with vue-resource
* State management with vuex
* Simple Python backend (Flask) with local Postgres DB on Pi
