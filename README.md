# Pokemon-Teams

An introductory VueJS app to record Pokemon teams used across various games and/or playthroughs.


## Project Goals
* Introductory Vue Project
* Routing with vue-router
* CRUD functionality
* Call an API with Axios
* State management with vuex
* Simple Python backend (Flask) with local Postgres DB on Pi

This was made to mess around with VueJS and is obviously not a production level application.
For sake of simplicity, this runs locally for a single user. 

**I really just wanted to focus on learning Vue with this project.**

## Setup
I wouldn't suggest setting this up.
But, I did take some notes in [docs/](docs/), [app/](app/), [api/](api/), and [data/](data/)**.

* Setup environment file at **/dev.env** based on **/dev.env.example**


| Port | Description | Docker ? |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| 5432 | Postgres    | No       |
| 8020 | Flask API   | Yes      |
| 8021 | Vue App     | Yes      |


## Missing Features
Features that I ended up leaving out because I got bored with the project.

* Display random team on home page
* Popup alerts for deleting, creating, etc.
* Form validation
* Better styling...lol
* There's most definitely some UI bugs I missed
