# Pokemon-Teams

An introductory VueJS app to record Pokemon teams used across various games and/or playthroughs.


## Project Goals
* Introductory Vue Project
* Routing with vue-router
* CRUD functionality
* External API usage with vue-resource
* State management with vuex
* Simple Python backend (Flask) with local Postgres DB on Pi

This was made to mess around with VueJS and is obviously not a production level application.
For sake of simplicity, this runs locally for a single user. 

**I really just wanted to focus on messing around with the frontend for this project.**
