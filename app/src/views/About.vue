      <p>
        I always wanted to learn how to use VueJS so I slapped together a project idea to practice with.
        I'm currently going through a huge Pokemon binge, so this was an idea I could stay interested in.
        <br><br>
        When I start a new playthrough of a Pokemon game, I never use the same Pokemon twice.
        This forces me to use different teams that I would have never used.
        Often times I forget what I have and haven't used, so an application like this would be pretty useful.
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-header">Project Details</h3>
      <p>
        The main focus of this side project was to mess with Vue, so the backend is kind of garbage.
        Additionally, this is for a single user and only ran locally. 
        I was feeling really lazy and didn't want to go through authentication, deploying, containerizing, etc.
        <br><br>
        For this little side project, I wanted to accomplish the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to VueJS</li>
          <li>Routing with vue-router</li>
          <li>CRUD functionality on a model</li>
          <li>Call an API with Axios</li>
          <li>State management with vuex</li>
          <li>Simple Python backend (Flask) and local Postgres DB (on Pi)</li>
        </ul>
        Overall I think VueJS is pretty neat. 
        However, I still think Angular is going to be my main frontend for other projects.
