# Pokemon-Teams-API

This API is junk, but it'll work for this project.
I'm trying to spend most of my effort on the frontend because its one of my weak skills.

The data is also super lightweight, so I don't do any kind of fun filters in the API (page, offset, limit, etc.).

I do actually need to formally learn Flask + SQLAlchemy at some point.
This guy's series of articles look really good - https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application
