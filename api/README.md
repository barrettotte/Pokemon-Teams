# Pokemon-Teams-API

This API is junk, but it'll work for this project.


This backend is meant to be super simple. I'm trying to focus more on frontend during this project.


The data is also super lightweight, so I don't do any kind of fun filters in the API.


I do actually need to formally learn Flask + SQLAlchemy at some point.
